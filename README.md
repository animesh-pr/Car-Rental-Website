ðŸš— Car Rental Website
The Car Rental Website is a full-featured web application designed to simplify the process of renting cars online. It offers an intuitive and responsive user interface for customers to browse through a wide variety of cars, filter them based on specific preferences like brand, type, price, or location, and book them with ease. Users can register, log in, view car details, and manage their bookings through their personal dashboards. The platform ensures a smooth rental experience by displaying real-time availability and secure booking flows.

On the admin side, the application includes a powerful dashboard where administrators can manage the fleet of vehicles, handle customer bookings, and access reports and statistics that provide insights into business performance. Admins can easily add new cars, update existing listings, remove inactive ones, and maintain full control over the rental operations.

The application is built with a modern tech stack, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontendâ€”optionally with frameworks like React or Vue for a more dynamic UIâ€”and a backend developed using Node.js and Express (or alternatively Django or Flask, depending on the tech preference). It connects to a robust database system like MongoDB or MySQL to handle data persistence and utilizes secure authentication methods such as JWT to ensure a safe login and booking process.

To run the project locally, you can simply clone the repository, install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend, and set up a .env file with necessary environment variables like database credentials and port numbers. The app can then be launched using basic commands (npm start or yarn start), and you'll have a fully working car rental system on your machine.

This project is open for contributions, whether it's to improve the UI, enhance functionality, fix bugs, or add integrations like a payment gateway or mobile responsiveness. It's licensed under the MIT License, so feel free to fork, extend, or build on top of it.

Whether you're building this for a portfolio project, a client, or just for learning, this Car Rental Website provides a strong foundation for any car rental business or booking system.
